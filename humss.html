      <h1>HUMSS (Humanities and Social Sciences)
      </h1>
			<p>
        HUMSS stands for Humanities and Social Sciences. It is an academic strand offered in senior high school in the Philippines that is designed to provide students with a strong foundation in the social sciences, humanities, and the arts.
<br><br>
The HUMSS strand is ideal for students who are interested in pursuing a career in the fields of social sciences, law, journalism, humanities, and the arts. It offers a wide range of subjects, including Philippine Politics and Governance, Creative Writing, Introduction to World Religions and Belief Systems, Philosophy, Psychology, Sociology, and Anthropology.
<br><br>
Students who choose the HUMSS strand will develop their critical thinking, research, and communication skills. They will also be exposed to various cultural and societal issues, allowing them to gain a better understanding of the world around them.
<br><br>
Moreover, HUMSS strand students are required to undergo work immersion programs where they are given the opportunity to apply their learning in real-world settings. They may work in government agencies, non-governmental organizations, media organizations, or any institution that focuses on social and cultural issues.
<br><br>
Upon completion of the HUMSS strand, students can pursue further education in the social sciences, humanities, or the arts. They can also pursue a wide range of careers such as writers, journalists, lawyers, researchers, educators, or social workers. The HUMSS strand equips students with the skills and knowledge they need to become critical thinkers, effective communicators, and responsible members of society.
