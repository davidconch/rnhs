      <h1>BUWAN NG WIKA
      </h1>
			<p>Buwan ng Wika is a month-long celebration in the Philippines that commemorates the Filipino language and culture. It is celebrated every August, and it is a time when Filipinos come together to appreciate their heritage and promote the use of the Filipino language.
<br><br>
        The celebration of Buwan ng Wika was established in 1955 through Proclamation No. 186 signed by then-President Ramon Magsaysay. It was originally called Linggo ng Wika and was celebrated during the week of August 13, the birthday of Filipino writer and nationalist, Manuel L. Quezon. In 1988, the celebration was extended to a month-long observance to promote the use of the Filipino language in different regions of the country.</p>
